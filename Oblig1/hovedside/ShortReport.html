People with cognitive and learning disabilities can more easily find and prioritize content on the page.
People using screen readers can skip to the main content directly and navigate to sections that are important to them.
Keyboard users can browse pages and their sections more efficiently. Otherwise, users have to press the tab key multiple times to navigate through all links in each section.
People using software that only shows the main content of a web page, such as people with cognitive disabilities, will receive better results if the page structure is correctly marked up.
People with visual impairments, including people with low vision, have cues that provide orientation on the page and in the content.
Mobile web users often have access to a so-called “reader” or “reading” mode that will only show the main content of the page if it is correctly marked up.
People using certain browser plugins can use landmark roles to jump to specific sections on a page.
There are additional benefits to a good, accessible page structure, beyond those experienced by people with disabilities. As an example, search engines can use the data to better index the content of a page.
